# Eclipsing-Binary-Modeling

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and modeling of an eclipsing binary star system using PHOEBE (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs) software. The goal is to accurately derive the system's parameters from observational data,
including light curves and radial velocity curves, and to recreate the system as described in referenced research paper.
